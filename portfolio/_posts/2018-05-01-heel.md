description: Jason King had an idea for an app. As a veterinary neurologist, he understood the connection between patient outcomes and careful compliance with prescription guidelines. A simple app to help pet parents follow prescriptions is just the launching point for a range of other tools to make life better. We helped Jason find the right balance of features for his MVP. That's "Minimum Viable Product" if you're new to the startup scene. ðŸ˜‰

For this project, we chose React-Native to build the mobile applications. React-Native is an open-source platform managed by Facebook that lets developer build true-native applications for both iOS and Android in a single codebase. That is a huge savings in initial time to launch and in the time required to support apps and add new features over the long haul.

For the web app- primarily used by veterinary clinics- we use NodeJS and React to build a clean, easy-to-use web app and an API that our mobile app can use to check on prescriptions and record dosage times.

Try out the mobile app! It's available on the app stores for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.heelapp.heel&hl=en) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/heel/id1316789744?ls=1&mt=8).
