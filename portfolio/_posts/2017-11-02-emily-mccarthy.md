description: Emily McCarthy came to us looking for a better way to manage and grow their online business. They were outgrowing their WordPress and WooCommerce based solution and wanted something easier to manage and run reports on, easier for their customers to use, and all in a modern design that matched their high standards. We helped them migrate to Shopify and built a custom monogram design tool so that customers could create exactly the product they were looking for every time.
