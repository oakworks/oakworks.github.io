### History
Over the last ten years or so, [Kelly Tours](http://www.kellytours.com) built a very capable system for organizing their business and taking customer bookings over the web. That the system was powered by Microsoft Access made the feat even more impressive. But the team began to see problems adding features and providing access to their offices as the company expanded into new markets. "The Database" was one of a handful of tools that managed various aspects of the business, and the company felt the time had come to invest in themselves and build the tool they really needed.

<br />


### Initial Discovery

Our work with Kelly Tours began with minor improvements to their existing site. While building a small new feature there, it became apparent that Kelly Tours wanted to massively expand the current toolset, and that doing so in the existing system would be difficult. They needed a user-friendly and mobile-responsive tool that would allow staff and tour leaders to manage their travelers' needs- from rooming arrangements, to dietary preferences, to trip addons. The tool would also need to deliver a smooth booking process for their customers. In January 2015, we started discussing the possibility of a major overhaul to their tour management system.

### Road Map
Before beginning development, we met with Kelly Tours staff several times to review all of the tools in play, and to gather their thoughts on the pressing needs and future goals for the company. Findings from these meetings were compiled into a Roadmap outlining multiple phases for development of a new web application, the Tour Store.

### Success

Phase 1 of the Tour Store went into production use on August 1 2015. For staff, this offered an easy-to-use tool for managing Student Tours. This included the ability to create rooming lists, group lists and emergency contact lists; to invite teachers to help organize the trip; and to track booking and payments in real time. For parents, the Tour Store provided a simple tool for booking their children on class trips, and allowed them to make payments in installments when it helped. In September, planning began for Phase 2, which will add additional tools for staff and will begin expanding the type of tours offered through the Tour Store.
