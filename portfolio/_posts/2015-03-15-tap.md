description: BlueFocus Media asked us to develop a new version of their existing Content Management System &amp; API which powers their TAP (Tourist Assistance Portal) kiosks.  The application helps BlueFocus Media deliver content, track user interactions, and visually display collected data to their customers on the TAP kiosks. TAP devices are stationed throughout various cities and enable tourists to start exploring from their hotel lobby.
