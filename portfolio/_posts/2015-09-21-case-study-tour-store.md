Our work with Kelly Tours began with minor improvements to their existing site: they needed a user-friendly tool that would allow staff and tour leaders to manage which travelers were in rooms together. In January 2015, we started discussing the possibility of major overhauls to their tour management system.

Over the last ten years or so, Kelly Tours built a very capable system for organizing the business and taking customer bookings over the web. That the staff interface was powered by Microsoft Access made the feat even more impressive, but the team was beginning to see problems adding new features and providing access to new offices as the Kelly Tours expanded into new markets. "The Database" was one of a handful of tools that managed various aspects of the business, and the company felt the time had come to invest in themselves and build the tool they really needed.

Before beginning development, the Oak.Works staff met with members of the Kelly Tours staff on three occassions (?) to review all of the tools in play, and to gather thoughts from the client about pressing needs and future goals for the company. Findings from these meetings were compiled into a Roadmap outlining multiple phases for development of a new web application, the Tour Store.

Phase 1 of the Tour Store went into production use on August 1 2015. For staff, this offered an easy-to-use tool for managing Student Tours. This included the ability to create rooming lists, group lists and emergency contact lists; to invite teachers to help organize the trip; and to track booking and payments in real time. For parents, the Tour Store provided a simple tool for booking their children on class trips, and allowed them to make payments in installments when it helped. In September planning began for Phase 2, which will add additional tools for staff and will begin expanding the type of tours offered through the Tour Store.
