### History

We were initially brought in to maintain, update, and improve the existing site built on the Magento Enterprise platform. The platform was showing its age, and it was evident that band-aid on top of band-aid had been applied to try to solve various problems. Constant patches led to slow load times, unexpected errors, and a high cost of ownership. While we were able to solve some of these problems both teams knew we would be moving off of Magento and onto a hosted platform when it came time to rebuild.

### What we worked on

Oak.Worksâ€™ worked hand-in-hand with the stakeholders at Savannah Bee Company to scope features, design solutions, and build out the new eCommerce experience via the BigCommerce platform. During our discovery phase, Google Analytics revealed that a small area of improvement in mobile conversion rates would mean a massive difference in sales.  So, improving the interface and experience on mobile became our primary area of focus throughout the project.

### How we did it
By working closely with the in-house print design team, we were able to take desktop designs and apply our best practices in areas of user experience to deliver a mobile responsive site for all screen sizes. We also came up with some clever ways to help customers navigate the site and created custom widgets that made it easier to add products to the cart viewed on mobile. 

<br />

### Success

Oak.Works launched the new site on time and under budget while delivering new features that saw conversion rates nearly double in the first two months. Solved longstanding inventory issues between web and retail. Delivered a solution that fully integrates point of sale (POS) retail store performance with eCommerce for accurate reporting.
